#' Plot a Taxonomic Hierarchy
#'
#' Create an interactive visualisation of a taxonomic hierarchy.
#'
#' @param graph a `taxonomy_graph` object, typically created with
#' [read_taxonomy()].
#' @param show character giving the names of taxons that should be visible.
#' The tree will be shown uncollapsed up to those taxons.
#' @param expand_rank character giving the names of ranks that should always
#' be expanded.
#' @param full_expand character giving the names of taxons that should be fully
#' expanded, i.e., all taxons below the given taxon should be visible. Note
#' that this does not expand the graph above the given taxon, such that the
#' expanded part may be invisible. Use `show` to expand the graph up to a
#' given taxon.
#' @param focus character giving one or several taxons to focus on. This means
#' that the tree up to this taxon will be expanded as well as the full
#' subtree below that taxon. It is equivalent to putting the same taxons in
#' `show` and `full_expand`. If `focus` is used, those other two arguments will
#' be ignored.
#' @param link_length length of the horizontal links that connect nodes
#' in pixels.
#' @param font_size font size of the labels in pixels.
#'
#' @details
#' The function makes use of the html widget defined in [`collapsibleTree`],
#' but not of the function [collapsibleTreeNetwork()]
#' from that package that can produce the same plot from the same input data.
#' `plot_taxonomy()` is less flexible than the function from
#' `collapsibleTree` but also much faster.
#'
#' @return
#' a htmlwidget with the interactive tree visualisation.
